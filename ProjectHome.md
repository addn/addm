. addm (pronounced "adam") is an operating system and virtual machine for serving the needs of adde, the secure and friendly editor and programming environment .

. the idea behind a virtual machine (vm)  is to make an easier job of writing safe software for several platforms
> . it is a very tiny program:
> ( all it does is translate your machine code to the host's machine code ) it simulates your favorite platform, and runs all your favorite software on any platform that can run  that one tiny program .

. Adam was the Bible's first man, and addm, being a computer system`s virtual machine,
is the first piece of software the system needs .
-- Adam is also the fabled  original sinner who everyone inherited sin's curse from:
and a machine that is not robust and stable can cause all the other software to inherit that instability .

. there is no code at this time; just a blog .
